    Impact on Mental Health
<br>
    <br>
     Extensive use of computers and digital devices can cause eyestrain, hand or wrist discomfort, and sleep problems, 
     which in turn may impact mental well-being. Physical strain often translates into mental strain if the body is not 
     properly cared for.
